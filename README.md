# Assembly Programming on STM32

## Introduction

This repository documents my journey of learning ARM Assembly on the **STM32 Discovery Board** with the **Cortex-M4** processor. Initially, I avoided Assembly due to its complexity, but revisiting it with more programming experience provided valuable insights into low-level programming and processor architecture.

## Why Learn Assembly?

While higher-level languages abstract hardware interactions, Assembly allows direct control over the processor, making it indispensable for:

- **Embedded Systems:** Optimizing performance and memory usage.
- **Real-Time Applications:** Ensuring precise timing and deterministic execution.
- **Low-Level Debugging:** Understanding how the CPU executes instructions.

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Pseudocode is Essential

Unlike higher-level languages, Assembly requires a structured approach. Writing pseudocode before coding helps break down logic and improves code clarity.

### 2. Memory Management is Critical

Understanding memory allocation and usage is crucial. Using **fixed-width data types** like `uint32_t` instead of `int` helps maintain control over memory.

### 3. Thinking in Binary

Operations like bitwise shifts and masking become second nature in Assembly:

- **Check if a number is odd:** Inspect the **least significant bit (LSB)**.
- **Multiply by 2:** Perform a **left shift operation** (`LSL`).

## Working with STM32 and Cortex-M4

The Cortex-M4 runs in **Thumb mode**, supporting both **16-bit and 32-bit** instructions (Thumb-2). While some instructions are restricted to registers `r0â€“r7`, Thumb-2 extends access to `r8â€“r12`, with special roles for `r13 (SP)`, `r14 (LR)`, and `r15 (PC)`.
